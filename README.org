* conge

ConGE is a console graphics engine for Windows.

An API overview can be found in [[conge_test.c]].

** Features

- Simple API: 5 LOC is enough to get you started.
- Real-time rendering in the /Windows console/.
- 16 colors and 256 ASCII characters to choose from.
- Support for keyboard and mouse input.
- Runs in any resolution. Verified to work in 60 FPS (see [[https://github.com/nonk123/micraneft][my game]]).

** Building

The provided =Makefile= works with =nmake=. The default target builds
ConGE as a static library, and the =test= target compiles [[conge_test.c]].

Once the library is built, you can compile, e.g., =main.c= with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cl main.c /link conge.lib user32.lib
#+END_SRC

Linking =user32.lib= is crucial because ConGE uses some of its
functions.
