* conge

ConGE is a console graphics engine for Windows.

An API overview can be found in [[conge_test.c]] and [[conge_test.cpp]].

** Features

- Simple API: 5 LOC is enough to get you started.
- Real-time rendering in the /Windows console/.
- 16 colors and 128 ASCII characters to choose from.
- Support for keyboard and mouse input.
- Runs in any resolution. Works in 60 FPS.

** Building

The provided =Makefile= builds the test programs. It is meant to work
with the MSVC compiler.

To compile a program with ConGE as dependency, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cl main.c conge_complete.c /link user32.lib
#+END_SRC

Compiling a C++ program isn't much different; you only need to include
the [[conge.hpp]] header. (mind the extension!)
